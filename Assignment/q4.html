A volcano is a mountain or hill with an opening.
When a volcano erupts, magma is pushed up through the opening with great force.
When magma reaches the Earth's surface, it is called lava. 
Lava can be as hot as 2,200°F (1,204°C).
Barren Island is an island located in the Andaman Sea.
It is the only confirmed active volcano in the Indian subcontinent, 
and the only active volcano along a chain of volcanoes from Sumatra to Myanmar.
<p>
The top 3 biggest volcanoes are Tamu Massif (Pacific Ocean),
 Mauna Loa (Hawaii), and Ojos del Salado (Chile).

 The temperature of the lava in the tubes is about 1,250 degrees Celsius 
 (2,200 degrees Fahrenheit).

On land, volcanoes form when one tectonic plate moves under another.
Usually a thin, heavy oceanic plate subducts, or moves under, a thicker continental plate.
When this happens, the ocean plate sinks into the mantle.

</p>
The chemical composition, volume of trapped gases, and temperature of the magma all
 determine the kind of volcano that will form and the type of eruption, if any.
   When magma is thick and sticky, there is a higher chance of explosive eruptions.
    This can be compared to a bottle of soda, which has carbon dioxide gas trapped in the liquid.
     Before it is opened, the CO2 has dissolved since the bottle is pressure-sealed. Therefore, 
     you cannot see the bubbles. If the bottle is shaken, the bubbles form; once the top is taken
      off, the soda shoots out because it is pushed out by the gas bubbles.
